Docker:
	It is a containerization platform to simplify the process of building, running, managing the application by using containers.
	Containers are lightweight, portable units.
	In containers stores package of application and application needs like code, libraries, dependencies.
	So that applications can work efficiently in different environment.



How Does Docker work:
	In our host machine an docker Engine or docker is a base engine in our computer to build and run containers using docker components and services.
	It uses client-server architecture.
	Comminication will be done through REST API between client and server.


DOCKER ENGINE:	
---------------------------------------------------------------
	CLIENT					SERVER
      Docker CLI <-----------REST-API-------> Docker Daemon

----------------------------------------------------------------


COMPONENTS OF COMPONENTS:
	
	Docker Client-Server Architecture
		      
		Docker Images

	Docker Containers
	
	Docker Registry

A container is a runnable instance of an image.

Give me a best youtube or website that deeply explain about docker

We can also add one or more networks, attach storage, create a new image from container.

You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI.

Images are read only and Containers are read write

Docker uses a technology called namespaces to provide the isolated workspace called the container.

When you run a container, Docker creates a set of namespaces for that container.
